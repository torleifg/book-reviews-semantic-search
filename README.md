# Semantic & Full-Text Search Engine for Books

This repository contains code and resources to run a semantic and full-text search engine for books. It utilizes text
embeddings and supports harvesting book metadata from various sources, using international standards like MARC21 and
ONIX 3.

The application leverages **Multilingual-E5-small** for generating text embeddings and **PostgreSQL** with **pgvector**
as vector store. This provides multilingual semantic search capabilities.

## Technologies

- **[Spring Boot 3](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)**
- **[Multilingual-E5-small](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-small)**: This pre-trained model is used for
  generating text embeddings.
- **[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)**: A PostgreSQL extension for storing and querying vectors, used as
  the vector store in the search engine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### 1. Create and run PostgreSQL database

Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the PostgreSQL database with pgvector enabled.

### 2. Configure the Gateway

Select and configure the appropriate gateway and service-uri for harvesting metadata by editing the application.yaml
file. Available options:

- oai-pmh
- bibbi
- bokbasen

### 3. Start the Application

The first run may take some time as it will download the necessary embedding models. Once the models are in place, the
application will be ready for use.

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### 4. Use the search engine

Visit ```http://localhost:8080``` in the browser and watch the results as the metadata harvesting progresses. For
semantic search enter a search query or leave it blank for a random choice (the first search hit will be the random
choice and the rest will be semantically similar books). For full-text search enter a search query.

## Gateway Configuration

The gateway component is responsible for:

- Translation: It translates metadata from the external service into a common model for the application.
- Abstraction: It abstracts away the details of the external service, handling the transformation of parameters and
  results.

The application supports three gateways. Custom mappers can be implemented as needed and activated by configuring the
appropriate values in the application.yaml file.

## Supported Gateways

### OAI-PMH

The OAI-PMH gateway harvests metadata using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). It
supports retrieving bibliographic data in MARC21 format.

- **[OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/)**
- **[MARC21](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/)**

Additional documentation for OAI-PMH from Biblioteksentralen (https://www.bibsent.no/):

- **[√Åja OAI-PMH API](https://doc.aja.bs.no/hente/bibliografiske-data/oai-pmh.html)** (requires no authentication)

### ONIX

The ONIX gateway uses the ONIX format for metadata, commonly employed in the publishing industry. This is particularly
useful for harvesting data from large-scale book vendors.

- **[ONIX 3.0](https://www.editeur.org/93/Release-3.0-and-3.1-Downloads/)**

### Bibbi

The Bibbi gateway is used for integrating with the Bibbi metadata service. The gateway uses a format based on
Schema.org.

- **[Schema.org](https://schema.org/)**
